# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# **Project 1:** Ross and Jerry's Restaurant Application - **_DUE: 06/06/22_**

## Description

Ross and Jerry's Cuisine is a restaurant that sells different types of kebabs. Customers can view our delicicacies and order directly with an account of their own. Admins are capable of adding, updating, and deleting the menu items. This application leverages a tomcat server to handle incoming requests to thoroughly tested services that must be persisted using Hibernate and Azure SQL services. This project includes a frontend that will be developed using ReactJS to handle user requests.

# User Stories

## As A: Admin

-   [ ] Add items to the menu
-   [ ] Update items to the menu
-   [ ] Delete items to the menu

## As A: Customer

-   [ ] View all items on the menu without needing to Register or Login
-   [ ] Register/Update/Delete an account
-   [ ] Add/Update/Delete a credit card to be saved to my account
-   [ ] Make an order for a specific menu item
-   [ ] Add a comment to the order to request a change, if it is substitutable
-   [ ] Favorite an order
-   [ ] View past orders by date
-   [ ] Pay off your balance with your credit card

## Required Challenge:

In this project, we are challenge to learn and implement the use of Hibernate and ORM for java. Below are resources given by our professor that can help with understanding how to leverage hibernate in our project. 

-   [What is an ORM and Why You Should Use It](https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-an-orm-and-why-you-should-use-it-b2b6f75f5e2a)

-   [Hibernate Documentation](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.4/)

-   [JPA and Hibernate](https://www.baeldung.com/jpql-hql-criteria-query)

-   [Tutorialspoint Hibernate](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/index.htm)

-   [Hibernate Session Factory](https://www.java2novice.com/hibernate/session-factory/)

## Tech Stack

-   [ ] Java 8
-   [ ] JUnit
-   [ ] Mockito
-   [ ] Apache Maven
-   [ ] Hibernate
-   [ ] Jackson library (for JSON marshalling/unmarshalling)
-   [ ] Java EE Servlet API (v4.0+)
-   [ ] Azure SQL
-   [ ] ReactJS Frontend
-   [ ] Git SCM (on GitHub)
-   [ ] Azure WebApps (Potentially)

## Functional Requirements

-   [ ] CRUD operations are supported for one or more domain objects via the web application's exposed endpoints
-   [ ] JDBC logic is abstracted away by hibernate
-   [ ] Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support) using hibernate
