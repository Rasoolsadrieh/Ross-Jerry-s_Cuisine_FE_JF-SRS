# **Project 1:** Ross and Jerry's Restaurant Application - **_DUE: 06/06/22_**

## Description

Ross and Jerry's Cuisine is a restaurant that sells different types of kebabs. Customers can view our delicicacies and order directly with an account of their own. Admins are capable of adding, updating, and deleting the menu items. This application leverages a tomcat server to handle incoming requests to thoroughly tested services that must be persisted using Hibernate and Azure SQL services. This project includes a frontend that will be developed using ReactJS to handle user requests.

## Required Challenge:

In this project, we are challenge to learn and implement the use of Hibernate and ORM for java. Below are resources given by our professor that can help with understanding how to leverage hibernate in our project. 

-   [What is an ORM and Why You Should Use It](https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-an-orm-and-why-you-should-use-it-b2b6f75f5e2a)

-   [Hibernate Documentation](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.4/)

-   [JPA and Hibernate](https://www.baeldung.com/jpql-hql-criteria-query)

-   [Tutorialspoint Hibernate](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/index.htm)

-   [Hibernate Session Factory](https://www.java2novice.com/hibernate/session-factory/)

## Tech Stack

-   [ ] Java 8
-   [ ] JUnit
-   [ ] Mockito
-   [ ] Apache Maven
-   [ ] Hibernate
-   [ ] Jackson library (for JSON marshalling/unmarshalling)
-   [ ] Java EE Servlet API (v4.0+)
-   [ ] Azure SQL
-   [ ] ReactJS Frontend
-   [ ] Git SCM (on GitHub)
-   [ ] Azure WebApps (Potentially)

## Functional Requirements

-   [ ] CRUD operations are supported for one or more domain objects via the web application's exposed endpoints
-   [ ] JDBC logic is abstracted away by hibernate
-   [ ] Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support) using hibernate
